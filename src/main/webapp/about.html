    <h1>About this sandbox</h1>

    <h2>About this sandbox</h2>

    <p>This sandbox have been realized in the context of the FUI
        <a href="http://opencloudware.org" target="_blank">OpenCloudware project</a>.
        This project aims at building an open software engineering platform for the collaborative development of
        distributed
        applications to be deployed on multiple Cloud infrastructures.
        The sandbox relies on BtrPlace, a component used inside the OpenCloudware project
        to automatically check for the constraints viability and fix them when necessary.
    </p>

    <p>The source code of this sandbox is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/fhermeni/btrplace-sandbox">Github</a>.
        Use that entry point to report bugs and feature requests.

    <h2>About BtrPlace</h2>

    <h3>Objectives</h3>

    <p>Clients of IaaS providers are looking for dependable infrastructures that can cope with their SLA
        requirements. To stay attractive, a cloud must then rely on a VM placement algorithm with features matching
        as possible the SLAs expectations. These constraints are however very specific to each of
        the tenants but also the infrastructure. They also cover a large
        range of concerns (reliability, performance, security,
        energy-efficiency, ...) that are continuously evolving according to
        new trends and new technologies. Current VM placement algorithms are
        designed as monolithic systems. Clouds administrators and clients
        are then passive actors, waiting for the future release of the
        placement algorithm that may match their current expectations.</p>

    <p>BtrPlace is the VM placement algorithm
        that is used inside the open source OW2 project <a href="http://ow2.org/view/ActivitiesDashboard/Entropy">Entropy</a>.
        BtrPlace can be specialized on demand by third party developers
        to integrate new placement constraints. It has already been used
        successfully to address high-availability, security but also
        energy-efficiency concerns. It has been developed since 2006
        with the <a href="http://www.emn.fr/z-info/ascola/doku.php">
            ASCOLA Research Team</a> from the <a href="http://www.mines-nantes.fr">Mines de Nantes</a>,
        then with the <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/oasis/">OASIS Research Team</a> from the
        <a href="http://unice.fr/">University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis</a>.</p>

    <p>BtrPlace relies on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming">Constraint Programming</a>
        to compute a new configuration and a plan to reach it when constraints are violated. This approach makes
        placement constraint independent of each other and new constraints can be added without changing the existing
        implementation of other constraints.

        In practice, BtrPlace uses the Open source <a href="http://www.emn.fr/z-info/choco-solver/">CHOCO solver</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>The BtrPlace constraint catalog</h3>

    <p>
        The BtrPlace constraints catalog aggregates constraints related to the management of VMs and servers on hosting
        platforms.
        It presents numerous constraints that are of a practical interest for applications and datacenter administrators
        to express dependability or management requirements such as performance, availability or security.
        Each constraint is associated with practical use cases and classification criteria to help users at
        understanding its interest and its relationship with others.
        An online version of the catalog is available
        <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Fabien.Hermenier/btrpcc/">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p> The catalog serves as a support to prove the flexibility of Btrplace.
        Currently, 14 of the presented constraints are available in BtrPlace and 10 of them can be tested in the
        sandbox.
        Non-implemented constraints will be implemented using BtrPlace and made available in the sandbox as soon as
        possible.
